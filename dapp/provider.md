# Provider

**Becoming a Provider**

To become a gym provider within the DeGym DAO ecosystem, facilities must lock in a minimum stake as proof of commitment. This staked amount serves as both a guarantee of the gym's commitment to the network and a means to facilitate smooth operational integrations.

**Setting Up Check-in Payments**

Each gym has the autonomy to set a minimum compensation they wish to receive for each check-in, correlating with the voucher tier they choose to accept. For example:

* **Gym A** may choose to only accept Gold tier members or higher, aiming for a premium clientele, thereby setting a higher minimum payment per check-in.
* **Gym B** might opt to accept Basic members, thus setting a lower payment threshold, which might attract more frequent check-ins but at lower rates per visit.

**Operational Details**

1. **Integration**: Gyms integrate DeGym's DLT to track visits and manage payments automatically.
2. **Customization**: Each gym can tailor the types of vouchers it accepts based on its business model and customer base.
3. **Rewards System**: Gyms benefit from increased traffic and participation through the DAO, enhancing their visibility and profitability within the network.

This model not only incentivizes gyms to maintain high standards to attract and retain members but also fosters a competitive environment where facilities are rewarded based on the value they provide to the community.
