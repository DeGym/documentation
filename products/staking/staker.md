# Staker

Stakers in DeGym DAO contribute by locking their DGYM tokens into the system. This staking not only supports the stability and security of the platform but also entitles stakers to various benefits.

**Staking Benefits**

1. **Revenue Sharing**: Stakers receive a portion of the fees collected from gym check-ins, particularly from days when users do not visit the gym. This creates a passive income stream based on the activity within the ecosystem.
2. **Governance Participation**: Stakers gain voting rights, allowing them to influence major decisions within DeGym DAO, including protocol updates and usage of community funds.
3. **Staking Rewards**: Additional rewards might be distributed to stakers based on the duration and amount of their stake, encouraging long-term holding and stability in the network.

**Staking Process**

1. **Token Purchase**: Buy DGYM tokens through supported exchanges.
2. **Lock Tokens**: Commit your tokens to the DeGym DAO staking contract.
3. **Manage Stake**: Monitor and manage your stake through the DeGym platform, with options to add or withdraw after certain periods as per the terms of the smart contract.

**Risk Management**

While staking provides an opportunity for rewards, it also comes with risks such as price volatility and locking periods. Stakers should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before committing funds.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive journey for stakers, ensuring they are rewarded for their investment and participation in the DeGym DAO ecosystem.

* **Reward System**: How rewards are calculated based on user activity and inactivity.
