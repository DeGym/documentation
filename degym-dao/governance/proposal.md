## <mark style="color:green;">DGIP - DeGym Improvement Proposals</mark> <a href="#template" id="template"></a>

Before any proposal goes for voting we create improvement proposals which will be stored on the following repository:

You can also submit your proposal on our [community discord](https://discord.gg/FtTcGh4q) through the \`#ðŸ’¡\_improvement-proposals \`.

## <mark style="color:green;">**Who can create proposals?**</mark> <a href="#template" id="template"></a>

Anyone having at least `500,000 $DGYM` tokens may make proposals, but for a proposal to be heard by the council, it needs to reach at least a minimum percentage (to be determined at network launch) of the entire DeGym token supply.

All proposals must adhere to the guidelines outlined in this section of the official DeGym Documentation, the latest published template, and must contain direct & objective descriptions. All other proposals will be deleted for housekeeping purposes.
