# ðŸ‘‘ Organization

DAO is self-governing organization that operate on smart contracts, allowing for transparent decision-making and governance.

Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in the people you're working with. But itâ€™s hard to trust someone youâ€™ve only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs we donâ€™t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAOâ€™s code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.

The DAO allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent.

This opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination.

## Scope <a href="#scope-of-the-dao" id="scope-of-the-dao"></a>

The DeGym DAO have built-in treasury that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting through the voting power of governance token (`DGYM`) to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain. It manages the degym protocol and all possible future sub-protocols by deciding on key parameters:

* Setting fees
* Staking epoch lengths
* Oracles

The DAO is the logical compromise between a team or a community-driven protocol, which allows the deployment of competitive products without full centralization and custody of the exchanges. While we have full trust in the Taraxa ecosystem, the chain is in its infancy and we strongly believe that running DeGym still needs to be mainly done by an underlying team. However, setting up a DAO is a statement to the future, where we, the DeGym team would step back and let DeGym thrive fully in the community's hands. For now, this is what the DAO will be tasked with:

* Enabling a focus on community might offer a more socially conscious structure and consequent decision-making;
* Covering the costs of developing and upgrading the protocol from the DAO token treasury, including the reimbursement of personnel or individual contractors;
* Takes care of other management activities as well if there is a technical ability or direct necessity;

The DAO will be the deciding body on changes in the protocol. Whether there's a quicker snapshot necessary or a better APY calculation, the DAO will decide.
