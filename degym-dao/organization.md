# ðŸ‘‘ Organization

DAO is self-governing organization that operate on smart contracts, allowing for transparent decision-making and governance.

Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in the people you're working with. But itâ€™s hard to trust someone youâ€™ve only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs we donâ€™t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAOâ€™s code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.

The DAO allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent.

This opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination. **DeGym is managed by the DeGym DAO**. The DAO members govern DeGym to ensure its efficiency and stability. The DeGym DAO should do the following

## Scope & Functions <a href="#scope-of-the-dao" id="scope-of-the-dao"></a>

The DeGym DAO have built-in treasury that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. The DeGym DAO should do the following:

* Build, deploy, update, and decide on key parameters of staking protocols, approve incentives for parties that contribute towards DAOâ€™s goals;
* Approve DGC (DeGym Grant Committee) grants to support different research and initiatives that are worked upon for the benefit of the protocol;
* Payments to full-time contributors and other operational duties;
* Bug bounty program, respond to emergencies;
* Accumulation of service fees from DeGym, which can be funneled into the insurance and development funds, distributed by the DAO;

Decisions are governed by proposals and voting through the voting power of governance token (`DGYM`) to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain. It manages the degym protocol and all possible future sub-protocols by deciding on key parameters:

* Inflation Decay Constant
* Max Supply
* Staking epoch lengths
* Oracles

The DAO is the logical compromise between a team or a community-driven protocol, which allows the deployment of competitive products without full centralization and custody of the exchanges.
