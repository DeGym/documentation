# Token Pre-Seed, Private Sale, and Public Sale

The DeGym project is embarking on a phased approach to raise funds and distribute tokens, ensuring fair market valuation and rewarding early investors. This document outlines the strategy for the pre-seed, private sale, and public sale phases, including token distribution, pricing, vesting periods, and the future adjustment of token prices.

## Pre-Seed Phase

* **Token Allocation:** 3% of the total token initial supply (300,000,000 DGYM)
* **Vesting Period:** To ensure commitment and gradual release of tokens
* **Unsold Tokens:** Any unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase will be burned forever to maintain scarcity and increase the value of circulating tokens
* **Objective:** Validate market interest, raise initial funds, and set a baseline for token value

### Vesting Schedule:

* **TGE (Token Generation Event):** 10% unlocked immediately
* **Monthly Vesting:** Remaining tokens vested over 12 months

### Key Points:

* **Fair Initial Pricing:** Tokens will be priced to attract early supporters while reflecting their future potential value.
* **Burning Unsold Tokens:** Any tokens not sold during the pre-seed phase will be burned, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

## Private-Sale Phase

* **Token Allocation:** 7% of the total token supply (700,000,000 DGYM)
* **Price Adjustment:** The price per token will be 10% higher than the final price from the pre-seed phase
* **Objective:** Raise significant funds for project development, marketing, and operational expenses

### Price Calculation:

* **Final Pre-Seed Price:** Determined based on the total market cap accumulated during the pre-seed phase
* **Private Sale Price:** 10% higher than the final pre-seed price to reward early investors and reflect the project's progress and increased value

## Public Sale Phase

* **Token Allocation:** 30% of the total token supply (3,000,000,000 DGYM)
* **Objective:** Raise significant funds for further project development, marketing, community building, and operational expenses

### Price Calculation

* **Pre-Seed Unsold Tokens:** All unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase will be permanently burned
* **Public Sale Price:** Determined based on the final private sale price to reflect the project's ongoing progress and market conditions

### Token Burn Mechanism

* Pre-Seed Unsold Tokens: All unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase will be burned
* **Purpose:** To create scarcity, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens

### Market Cap Adjustment

* The price per token will be adjusted based on the market cap accumulated during each sale phase. This ensures a fair valuation and aligns the token price with the project's progress and market demand.

### Summary

1. **Pre-Seed Phase:**
   * Allocate 3% of tokens
   * Vesting period with monthly releases
   * Burn unsold tokens
2. **Private Sale Phase:**
   * Allocate 7% of tokens
   * Price 10% higher than pre-seed final price
3. **Public Sale Phase:**
   * Allocate 30% of tokens
   * Price determined based on final private sale price
4. **Token Burn:**
   * Burn all unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase

This phased approach ensures fair distribution, rewards early investors, and aligns token prices with market demand and project progress.
