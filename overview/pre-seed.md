# Pre-Seed and Pre-Sale Token Distribution Plan for DeGym Project

## Overview

The DeGym project is embarking on a phased approach to raise funds and distribute tokens, ensuring fair market valuation and rewarding early investors. This document outlines the strategy for the pre-seed and pre-sale phases, including token distribution, pricing, vesting periods, and the future adjustment of token prices.

### Token Distribution

- Total Token Supply: 10,000,000,000 DGYM
- Current Supply (Minted): 1,000,000,000 DGYM
- Max Supply: 10,000,000,000 DGYM

### Pre-Seed Phase

- Token Allocation: 3% of the total token supply (300,000,000 DGYM)
- Vesting Period: To ensure commitment and gradual release of tokens
- Unsold Tokens: Any unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase will be burned forever to maintain scarcity and increase the value of circulating tokens
- Objective: Validate market interest, raise initial funds, and set a baseline for token value

### Vesting Schedule:

- TGE (Token Generation Event): 10% unlocked immediately
- Monthly Vesting: Remaining tokens vested over 12 months

### Key Points:

- Fair Initial Pricing: Tokens will be priced to attract early supporters while reflecting their future potential value.
- Burning Unsold Tokens: Any tokens not sold during the pre-seed phase will be burned, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

### Pre-Sale Phase

- Token Allocation: 10% of the total token supply (1,000,000,000 DGYM)
- Price Adjustment: The price per token will be 10% higher than the final price from the pre-seed phase
- Objective: Raise significant funds for project development, marketing, and operational expenses

### Price Calculation:

- Final Pre-Seed Price: Determined based on the total market cap accumulated during the pre-seed phase
- Pre-Sale Price: 10% higher than the final pre-seed price to reward early investors and reflect the project's progress and increased value

### Token Burn Mechanism

- Pre-Seed Unsold Tokens: All unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase will be permanently burned
- Purpose: To create scarcity, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens

### Market Cap Adjustment

- The price per token will be adjusted based on the market cap accumulated during the pre-seed phase. This ensures a fair valuation and aligns the token price with the project's progress and market demand.

### Summary

1. Pre-Seed Phase:
    - Allocate 3% of tokens
    - Vesting period with monthly releases
    - Burn unsold tokens

2. Pre-Sale Phase:
    - Allocate 10% of tokens
    - Price 10% higher than pre-seed final price

3. Token Burn:
   - Burn all unsold tokens from the pre-seed phase

This phased approach ensures fair distribution, rewards early investors, and aligns token prices with market demand and project progress.
