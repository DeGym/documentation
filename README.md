This project is a decentralized autonomous organization for managing gym access and rewards using DLT enhaced with smart contracts. Consumers can purchase NFTs vouchers for access, Providers (gyms, studios, or well-being services) can provide your services in order to boost their revenue, and various rewards systems are implemented.
