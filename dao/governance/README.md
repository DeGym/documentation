# Governance

DeGym's governance is an evolving process that aims to eventually achieve what's described in the [Organization](../organization.md). For now, governance for major decisions in the ecosystem will go through an on-chain, direct-election governance vote where DGYM holders directly decide the direction the ecosystem takes.

## <mark style="color:green;">Where are the governance vote proposals?</mark>

All governance vote proposals are stored on Github: [https://github.com/DeGym/DGIP](https://github.com/DeGym/DGIP).

Before a governance vote passes, they're called DeGym Improvement Proposals, or DGIP. It is a public repository and anyone can create a pull request to submit a proposal. Please make sure that proposals are well-articulated and well-researched, so that the DeGym community is able to make an informed decision during the governance vote.

Once these proposals make it to the governance vote, they'll also appear on snapshot.org (see below).

## <mark style="color:green;">What's the voting system?</mark>

The development team is bound by the outcome of the vote, and will implement whatever the outcome of the governance vote is.

The development team will adhere to a First Past the Post (FPTP) voting system, which means plurality wins. In most cases there will be just a yes / no response, so plurality would mean majority in these cases. FPTP is the oldest and most common form of voting system, typically used during direct elections, which is what DeGym's current governance system uses.

In direct elections, the concept of quorum also does not apply. Quorum is a concept applicable to deliberative assemblies, or a body filled with representatives that were directly elected to their seats. Therefore there are no quorum considerations.

## <mark style="color:green;">Which wallets can vote?</mark>

All wallets on the DeGym network is able to vote on ongoing proposals.

DGYM stored on exchanges cannot be counted in voting. If your DGYM are on an exchange but wish to vote, you could pull the tokens out of an exchange into a wallet and participate in voting. You just need to make sure that the transfer occurs before the vote's snapshot cutoff (see below).

## <mark style="color:green;">How are votes counted?</mark>

A wallet's vote counts 2 components:

* Wallet's DGYM balance;
* Wallet's staked DGYM balance.

If you have 1 DGYM in your wallet, and you have 99 DGYM staked, then your total voting weight is 1 + 99 = 100.
