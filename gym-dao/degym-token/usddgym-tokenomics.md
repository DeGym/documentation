### Utility

The $DGYM token serves multiple utility functions within the DeGym DAO ecosystem, enhancing its intrinsic value and usability:

* **Access and Voucher:** Tokens can be used to purchase NFT-based gym voucher, providing access to a network of gyms.
* **Staking Rewards:** Token holders can stake their $DGYM to earn rewards, which incentivizes security and participation in the network.
* **Governance:** $DGYM holders have voting rights in the DAO, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes regarding the development and rules of the ecosystem.
* **Payment and Incentives:** Gyms receive $DGYM tokens as payment for check-ins, and users may receive tokens as rewards for fitness-related activities and promotions.

These utilities ensure that $DGYM remains a vital and active component of the DeGym ecosystem, facilitating both operational needs and strategic growth.

**No Slashing**

DeGym will not implement a slashing or punishment mechanisms at this moment.

It is incredibly difficult to design economic incentive schemes that properly motivate players in a system to behave in ways that are deemed constructive. As a rule, such mechanisms need to be as simple as possible, as more complexity creates more opportunities to game these mechanisms.
