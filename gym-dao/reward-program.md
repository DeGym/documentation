# ðŸ’Ž Reward

The reward programs for DGYM and Comercial Tokens in DeGym are designed to incentivize and reward stakeholders based on their participation and commitment to the platform. The DGYM rewards are influenced by the amount staked and the duration of the stake, while the comercial  rewards (derived from the voucher sellings) are only based on the amount staked.

## Rewarding DGYM

### Inflow

Inflows of DGYM are generated through [inflation](degym-tokenomics/inflation.md).

### Distribution

Distributions are triggered at every period where DGYM is inflated. The distribution weight is calculated based on the amount staked and the locked time.

### Outflow

After distribution, stakeholders can claim the DGYM amount that is not set to auto compound.

```

## Rewarding Comercial Token

### Inflow

Inflows of the comercial token are generated through voucher sales.

### Distribution

Distributions are triggered at every voucher renewal. The distribution weight is calculated based on the amount staked.

### Outflow

After distribution, stakeholders can claim the comercial token at any moment.

## Key Features

* **Inflation Mechanism**: The reward distribution is more favorable in the early stages and gradually decreases over time.
* **Stake Amount and Duration**: Both the amount staked and the duration of the lock influence the reward distribution.
* **Comercial Token Rewards**: Users are rewarded in Comercial Token based on voucher purchases, distributed according to the stake amount.
