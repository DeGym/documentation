# Smart Contracts

GitHub is a vital platform for software development, serving as a central hub where developers and teams collaborate on code. It's the foundation of open-source projects worldwide, including the DeGym project. On GitHub, you'll find the actual codebase of DeGym's smart contracts, witnessing the ongoing development and evolution of our DApp.
